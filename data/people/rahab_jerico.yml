description: |
  Rahab was a [[canaanite]] woman in [[jericho]] who hid the [[israelite]] spies sent by [[joshua]]. 
  Because of her actions, she and her family were spared during the conquest of the city. 
  She is later mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in [[ref:Matthew 1:5]] and praised for her faith in [[ref:Hebrews 11:31]].
  Scholars note that she should not be confused with the [[rahab_monster]] mentioned in [[ref:Psalm 89:10]] and [[ref:Job 26:12]].

notes:
  - "Rahab’s story bridges the Old and New Testaments."
  - "Some extra-biblical sources, like Josephus, recount her story in a similar way to [[joshua]]."
  - "Her inclusion among women in [[jesus]]’ genealogy is notable and discussed in multiple commentaries."
  - "Scholarly debate exists on the historical versus symbolic elements of her story."
