# Rahab
**person**

Rahab was a [tribe/canaanite](/bible-atlas/tribe/canaanite) woman in [place/jericho](/bible-atlas/place/jericho) who hid the [tribe/israelite](/bible-atlas/tribe/israelite) spies sent by Joshua 2. 
Because of her actions, she and her family were spared during the conquest of the city.[^test_footnote]
She is later mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in [Matthew 1:5](https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/1-5.htm) and praised for her faith in [Hebrews 11:31](https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/11-31.htm). 
Scholars note that she should not be confused with the [creature/rahab_monster](/bible-atlas/creature/rahab_monster) mentioned in [Psalm 89:10](https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/89-10.htm) and [Job 26:12](https://biblehub.com/context/job/26-12.htm).
Rahab's story bridges the Old and New Testaments. Some extra-biblical sources, like Josephus[^josephus_note_1], recount her story in a similar way to Joshua 2.
Her inclusion among women in Jesus' genealogy is notable and discussed in multiple commentaries. Scholarly debate exists on the historical versus symbolic elements of her story.
